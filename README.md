# SeleniumJavaAutomation

This simple project is created as an excercise and currently is Work In Progress.

It roughly follows a very popular online Selenium training, however I decided to do all the tasks in a different (maybe better) way than presented on the videos.

Characteristics:
- Page-Object Model
- PageFactory
- Allure steps
- each @Test is run in a sepparate browser instance
